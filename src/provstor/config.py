Configuration file support.

Looks for configuration files in ./provstor.config and ~/.provstor/config. If
both are present, the corresponding configurations are merged, and in case of
conflicting settings the former overrides the latter.

Example:

[fuseki]
base_url = http://localhost:3030
dataset = ds

[minio]
store = localhost:9000
user = minio
secret = miniosecret
bucket = crates
